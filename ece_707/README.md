**Summary:**
This course is intended as a first semester graduate course on linear systems theory, design and implementation
with application to signal processing, communications, estimation and control. The objective is to present a
comprehensive coverage of the basic tools needed by an electrical engineering graduate student specializing in
the above areas.

**Prerequisites:**
Engineering mathematics and basic linear algebra
